HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

Part 1:
In order to run this program, run both the client and the server, then within the terminal, copy the key from
the client into the server and vice versa. From here the program will send messages and encrypt/decrypt
them, before automatically shutting down.
Part 2:
In order to run this program, run both the client and the server. If you are running this from the
commandline, you need to enter the password which in this case is "badpassword". From here the
program will send messages and encrypt/decrypt them, before automatically shutting down.

DESIGN CHOICES

My design choices in this program have changed throughout the programming process. Initially I had a design where
I split up each action for the program into separate methods as I thought that would be easier to read and
easier to debug. However I came across a lot of issues designing my program this way so I eventually decided
to move all of my methods into my main sendMessage method in my client. This made the code easier to program
as I was passing the same variables down through the same method rather than having lots of fields and multiple
different variables.

TESTING

In order to test and bugfix this program, I used a combination of print statements throughout the code, and
error messages such as exceptions that I can print the stack trace to. This helped me figure out where I had
gone wrong in my code and I used this to create a completely bug-free program.
